        {

          "text": "Bold text"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìä Analytics & Metrics

The system tracks:
- **View Counts**: Total views per post
- **Read Rates**: Percentage of users who read posts
- **Reading Time**: How long users spend reading
- **Engagement**: Reaction counts and types
- **Popular Content**: Most viewed and reacted posts

## üîê Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public Read**: Published posts visible to all
- **Admin Control**: Only admins can create/edit posts
- **User Reactions**: Users can only manage their own reactions
- **Read Tracking**: Users can only track their own reads

### Content Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized
- Rich content structure prevents XSS
- Image URLs are validated

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Posts not appearing:**
- Check post status is 'published'
- Verify published_at date is in the past
- Check expires_at is null or in the future

**Read tracking not working:**
- Ensure user is logged in
- Check browser supports Intersection Observer
- Verify 3-second viewing threshold

**Reactions not updating:**
- Check user authentication
- Verify database permissions
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check post status
SELECT title, status, published_at, expires_at 
FROM news_posts 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View read statistics
SELECT p.title, COUNT(r.id) as read_count
FROM news_posts p
LEFT JOIN news_post_reads r ON p.id = r.post_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.title
ORDER BY read_count DESC;

-- Reaction statistics
SELECT p.title, pr.reaction_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM news_posts p
JOIN news_post_reactions pr ON p.id = pr.post_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.title, pr.reaction_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
