1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/infantry-blob-viewer.git
   cd infantry-blob-viewer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Development Mode

For active development with auto-recompilation:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Watch TypeScript files for changes
- Auto-compile on save
- Serve the application on localhost:8080

## Usage

### Loading BLO Files

**Single File:**
1. Click **"Load BLO File"** button
2. Select an Infantry BLO file from your system
3. Wait for sprites to load and appear in the tree view

**Directory Loading:**
1. Click **"Load Directory"** button
2. Select a folder containing multiple BLO files
3. Browse through the hierarchical tree view

### Sprite Navigation

**Sprites Tab:**
- Browse sprites using the tree view on the left
- Search sprites with the search box
- Select sprites to view in the center canvas
- Use expand/collapse controls for large collections

**Animation Controls:**
- Control playback with Play/Pause/Stop buttons
- Adjust animation speed (1-20, default: 15)
- Navigate frames manually with Row/Column sliders
- View current CFS timing information

**Visual Adjustments:**
- Adjust zoom level with slider or preset buttons
- Modify HSV values for color effects
- Change background color for better contrast
- View sprite dimensions and frame information

### Audio Features

**Audio Tab:**
- Load and play WAV audio files embedded in BLO files
- Visual waveform display
- Volume control and playback management
- Audio metadata viewing

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab**: Switch between Sprites and Audio tabs
- **Space**: Play/Pause animation (when on Animation tab)
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate frames (when focused on sliders)
- **‚Üë‚Üì**: Navigate BLO files
- **‚Üê‚Üí**: Navigate sprites within selected BLO

## What is Infantry Online?

Infantry Online was a 2D multiplayer combat game that used BLO (Blob) files to store game assets including sprites, animations, and audio. This viewer allows you to:

- Extract and view sprite graphics from BLO files
- Play back sprite animations with original timing
- Listen to embedded audio files
- Analyze the structure and metadata of game assets

## Acknowledgments

This project is built upon the foundational work of the [Gibbed.Infantry](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Infantry) project by Rick. The BLO and CFS file format parsing, data structures, and core concepts for handling Infantry Online assets are derived from that excellent work.

**Key contributions from Gibbed.Infantry:**
- BLO file format specification and parsing logic
- CFS (Compressed Frame Set) decompression algorithms
- Sprite frame structure and metadata handling
- Palette and color management systems

This web-based implementation represents a modernized, cross-platform adaptation of those foundational tools, reimplemented in TypeScript for browser-based usage while maintaining compatibility with the original file formats.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**BLO files not loading:**
- Ensure BLO file is valid Infantry Online format
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify file isn't corrupted or truncated

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce zoom level for large sprites
- Close other browser tabs
- Use Chrome/Firefox for best performance
- Try loading fewer BLO files at once

**Build errors:**
- Ensure Node.js v16+ is installed
- Run `npm install` to update dependencies
- Clear dist folder: `npm run clean`

**Audio not playing:**
- Verify BLO file contains audio data
- Check browser audio permissions
- Test with different BLO files

### Getting Help

- Check browser developer console for errors
- Verify BLO file format compatibility
- Test with known working BLO files first
- Report issues on GitHub with sample files (if possible)
