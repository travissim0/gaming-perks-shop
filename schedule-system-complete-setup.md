# Complete Schedule System Setup Guide

## Summary
Fixed all schedule proposal issues by moving the system to the matches page where it belongs, with proper accept/reject functionality for team owners.

## 🛠️ **Step 1: Create Missing Database Table**

Run this SQL script in Supabase: `create-schedule-proposals-table.sql`

This creates the `tt_match_schedule_proposals` table that was missing and causing the error.

## 🛠️ **Step 2: Update Backend Functions** 

Run this SQL script in Supabase: `fix-schedule-timezone-and-responses.sql`

This provides:
- ✅ **EST Timezone Handling** - All times properly converted to Eastern
- ✅ **Accept/Reject/Counter Functions** - Complete proposal response system
- ✅ **Event Notifications** - All actions generate proper events

## 🎯 **Step 3: Frontend Changes Applied**

### **Matches Page (`src/app/triple-threat/matches/page.tsx`)**:
- ✅ **Schedule Proposals Display** - Shows pending proposals directly on match cards
- ✅ **Accept/Reject/Counter Buttons** - Team owners can respond to proposals
- ✅ **Default 9:00 PM Time** - Time picker defaults to 21:00 (9:00 PM EST)
- ✅ **Team Owner Detection** - Only team owners see proposal/response options
- ✅ **Real-time Updates** - Proposals load with matches and update after responses

### **Enhanced Match Display**:
- **Scheduled Matches** - Show "🕒 Scheduled: Date at Time EST"
- **Unscheduled Matches** - Show "⏰ Needs Scheduling"
- **Pending Proposals** - Beautiful cards showing:
  - Who proposed the time
  - Proposed date/time in EST
  - Optional message from proposer
  - Accept/Reject/Counter buttons (for receiving team owner)
  - "Waiting for response..." (for proposing team owner)

## 🎉 **How It Now Works**:

### **Team Owner Experience**:
1. **Propose Schedule** - Click "📅 Propose Schedule" on unscheduled matches
2. **Default Time** - Time picker starts at 9:00 PM EST for convenience
3. **See Proposals** - All pending proposals appear directly on match cards
4. **Respond to Proposals** - Accept ✅, Counter 📅, or Reject ❌ buttons
5. **Lock in Time** - Once accepted, time is locked unless new proposal made

### **Notification Flow**:
- **Proposal Sent** - Other team gets notification in header
- **Response Actions** - Acceptance/rejection also sends notifications
- **Events Page** - All scheduling activity logged in events

### **Visual Design**:
- **Clean Match Cards** - Proposals integrated directly into match display
- **Color Coding** - Green for scheduled, orange for needs scheduling, cyan for proposals
- **Owner-Only Actions** - Only team owners see proposal/response buttons
- **EST Time Display** - All times clearly marked as EST

## 🔧 **Key Fixes Applied**:

1. **❌ Missing Table Error** → ✅ Created `tt_match_schedule_proposals` table
2. **❌ Wrong Timezone (6PM→1AM)** → ✅ Proper EST conversion in backend
3. **❌ Events Page Buried** → ✅ Schedule system moved to matches page
4. **❌ No Accept/Reject UI** → ✅ Team owners get accept/reject/counter buttons
5. **❌ No Default Time** → ✅ Time picker defaults to 9:00 PM EST
6. **❌ No Owner Detection** → ✅ Only team owners can propose/respond

## 🎯 **Result**:

Now when you propose a match time:
- ✅ **9:00 PM Default** - Time picker starts at 9:00 PM for convenience
- ✅ **EST Display** - Times show correctly as "9:00 PM EST" (not 1:00 AM)
- ✅ **Matches Page** - Proposals appear directly on match cards
- ✅ **Team Owner Control** - Only team owners can propose/accept/reject
- ✅ **Locked Schedules** - Once accepted, time is locked until new proposal
- ✅ **Clean UX** - Everything in one place on the matches page

The schedule system is now exactly where it should be - integrated into the matches page with proper team owner controls! 🚀⚔️
