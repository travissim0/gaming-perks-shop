# 🏛️ Legacy Squad System Implementation

## Overview

The Legacy Squad System allows preserving historical squads while enabling flexible membership rules. Players can simultaneously be members of both legacy squads (for historical purposes) and active squads (for current gameplay).

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### 🔧 Database Changes (Applied)
- ✅ Added `is_legacy` column to `squads` table (default: false)
- ✅ Created database functions for legacy validation:
  - `can_join_squad(user_id UUID, target_squad_id UUID)` - Validates squad joining rules
  - `get_user_active_squad(user_id UUID)` - Gets user's active (non-legacy) squad
  - `get_user_legacy_squads(user_id UUID)` - Gets user's legacy squads
  - `can_be_free_agent(user_id UUID)` - Checks if user can be free agent
  - `get_free_agents_excluding_active_only()` - Returns free agents not in active squads
- ✅ Updated RLS policies to handle legacy squad membership
- ✅ Added performance indexes for `is_legacy` queries

### 🎯 Core Features

#### Legacy Squad Rules
1. **Multi-Membership**: Players can be on both legacy and active squads simultaneously
2. **Role Flexibility**: Can be captain/co-captain of legacy squad AND any role on active squad
3. **Free Agent Compatibility**: Legacy squad membership doesn't block free agent status
4. **Squad Joining**: Legacy squads can always be joined (no active squad blocking)

#### Admin Management
- ✅ Updated `/admin/squads` page with legacy controls
- ✅ "Make Legacy" / "Un-Legacy" toggle buttons
- ✅ Legacy filter tab showing all historical squads
- ✅ Updated status displays (🏛️ Legacy, 🟢 Active, 🔴 Inactive)
- ✅ Separate stats for Active, Inactive, and Legacy squads

#### User Experience
- ✅ Free agent system respects legacy rules
- ✅ Squad joining validation uses legacy logic
- ✅ Updated squad detail pages with legacy awareness

### 📊 Statistics (Current)
Based on test results:
- **Total Squads**: 12
- **Active Squads**: 5 (non-legacy, currently playing)
- **Inactive Squads**: 7 (non-legacy, not currently playing)
- **Legacy Squads**: 0 (newly created system, ready for designation)
- **Free Agents**: 35 (can now include legacy squad members)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### Database Functions
```sql
-- Example usage:
SELECT can_join_squad('user-uuid', 'squad-uuid');
SELECT * FROM get_user_active_squad('user-uuid');
SELECT * FROM get_user_legacy_squads('user-uuid');
SELECT can_be_free_agent('user-uuid');
```

#### Updated Components
1. **Admin Squad Management** (`/admin/squads`)
   - Legacy toggle functionality
   - Updated filtering and stats
   - Visual indicators for legacy status

2. **Free Agent System** (`/free-agents`)
   - Legacy-aware membership checking
   - Updated eligibility validation

3. **Squad Detail Pages** (`/squads/[id]`)
   - Legacy-aware joining logic
   - Updated permission checking

4. **Supabase Helpers** (`supabaseHelpers.ts`)
   - Enhanced free agent checking
   - Legacy squad validation

### 🎮 Usage Instructions

#### For Admins
1. Go to `/admin/squads`
2. Use the "Legacy" filter tab to view current legacy squads
3. Click "Make Legacy" on any squad to preserve it historically
4. Legacy squads can't be activated/deactivated (they're historical)
5. Use "Un-Legacy" to restore a squad to normal operation

#### For Users
1. **Active Squad Members**: Can still join legacy squads for historical recognition
2. **Legacy Squad Members**: Can join new active squads without leaving legacy squad
3. **Free Agents**: Legacy squad membership doesn't prevent free agent status
4. **Squad Captains**: Can be captain of legacy squad AND member/officer of active squad

### 🚀 Benefits

1. **Historical Preservation**: Keep important squad history without losing functionality
2. **Flexible Membership**: Players aren't locked into one squad choice
3. **Seamless Transition**: Inactive squads can become legacy without losing data
4. **Free Agent Pool**: More players available as legacy membership doesn't block
5. **Administrative Control**: Easy squad lifecycle management

### 📝 Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Historical Champions
- "2023 Champions [CHMP]" squad becomes legacy
- Former captain can join "2024 Contenders [CONT]" as regular member
- Still shows as CHMP captain in legacy records
- Can appear in free agent pool if not on active squad

#### Scenario 2: Inactive Squad Revival
- Old inactive squad "Veterans [VET]" marked as legacy
- Members can join active squads
- VET history preserved
- If VET wants to return, admin can "Un-Legacy" to reactivate

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Squad Recognition
- Player was on multiple important historical teams
- Can be member of several legacy squads simultaneously
- Active squad membership separate from legacy recognition

### 🔧 Maintenance

#### Regular Tasks
1. **Review Inactive Squads**: Consider converting old inactive squads to legacy
2. **Monitor Legacy Count**: Ensure legacy squads remain historical (not active gameplay)
3. **Database Performance**: Legacy queries are optimized with indexes

#### Troubleshooting
- If legacy functions fail, system falls back to original logic
- All changes are backwards compatible
- Legacy status is optional and defaults to false
