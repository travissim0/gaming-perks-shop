# ‚òï Ko-fi Donation Integration

This document covers the complete Ko-fi integration that adds Ko-fi as an alternative donation method alongside Stripe.

## üéØ Overview

Ko-fi integration provides users with an alternative to Stripe for making donations. The system automatically tracks Ko-fi donations via webhooks and displays them in the admin dashboard alongside Stripe donations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dual Payment Options**: Users can choose between Stripe and Ko-fi
- **Automatic Tracking**: Ko-fi donations are automatically captured via webhooks
- **Admin Dashboard**: Unified view of all donations with payment method filtering
- **User Matching**: Ko-fi donations are linked to user accounts when possible
- **Export Support**: CSV exports include both Stripe and Ko-fi donations
- **Visual Distinction**: Payment methods are clearly distinguished in the UI

## üîó Webhook Details

### Ko-fi Webhook Data Structure

```json
{
  "verification_token": "your_token",
  "message_id": "unique_id",
  "timestamp": "2023-12-07T10:30:00Z",
  "type": "Donation",
  "from_name": "Supporter Name",
  "message": "Keep up the great work!",
  "amount": "5.00",
  "currency": "USD",
  "email": "supporter@example.com",
  "kofi_transaction_id": "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444",
  "url": "https://ko-fi.com/supporterpage",
  "is_public": true
}
```

### Webhook Processing

1. **Verification**: Checks verification token if configured
2. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate donations
3. **User Matching**: Links donation to user account if email matches
4. **Data Storage**: Saves all Ko-fi specific information
5. **Status**: Marks donation as 'completed' immediately

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Frontend Integration Test**
   ```bash
   # Visit donate page
   # Select Ko-fi method
   # Verify redirect works
   ```

2. **Webhook Test**
   ```bash
   # Use Ko-fi webhook tester
   # Or make real test donation
   # Check database for new entry
   ```

3. **Admin Dashboard Test**
   ```bash
   # Check stats show Ko-fi breakdown
   # Filter by Ko-fi donations
   # Export CSV with Ko-fi data
   ```

### Deployment Check

Run the deployment checker:

```bash
node deploy-kofi-integration.js
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Ko-fi Donations Not Appearing

1. **Check Webhook URL**: Ensure it's correctly set in Ko-fi dashboard
2. **Verify HTTPS**: Ko-fi requires HTTPS for webhooks
3. **Check Logs**: Look at webhook endpoint logs
4. **Test Webhook**: Use Ko-fi's webhook testing tool

#### Database Errors

1. **Schema Check**: Ensure `add-kofi-donations.sql` was applied
2. **Permissions**: Verify RLS policies allow webhook inserts
3. **Column Types**: Check column types match expected data

#### Frontend Issues

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure Supabase credentials are correct
2. **Ko-fi URL**: Verify Ko-fi profile URL is correct
3. **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check database schema
node deploy-kofi-integration.js

# Test webhook locally (if using ngrok)
curl -X POST https://your-ngrok-url.com/api/kofi-webhook \
  -F 'data={"verification_token":"test","type":"Donation","amount":"5.00","from_name":"Test User","kofi_transaction_id":"test-123","currency":"USD","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Donation Method Split**: Stripe vs Ko-fi usage
2. **Average Donation Size**: Compare between methods
3. **Conversion Rates**: Success rates for each method
4. **User Preferences**: Which method users prefer

### Monitoring Webhooks

```sql
-- Check recent Ko-fi donations
SELECT 
  kofi_transaction_id,
  amount_cents,
  kofi_from_name,
  created_at
FROM donation_transactions 
WHERE payment_method = 'kofi' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Ko-fi vs Stripe comparison
SELECT 
  payment_method,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(amount_cents) as total_cents,
  AVG(amount_cents) as avg_cents
FROM donation_transactions 
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY payment_method;
```
