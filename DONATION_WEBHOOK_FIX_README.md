# Donation Webhook Issue Fix

This document explains the donation tracking issue that was discovered and how it was resolved.

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Donations were being created in the database with "pending" status but never getting updated to "completed" status, causing them not to appear in the user's dashboard donation totals.

**Symptoms**:
- Donations appeared to process successfully in Stripe
- Users received donation success page
- Donations didn't show up in dashboard totals or recent donations
- All donations stuck in "pending" status in database

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the webhook processing flow:

1. **Donation Creation**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
   - User initiates donation on `/donate` page
   - `donation-checkout` API creates Stripe session with correct metadata
   - Database record created with "pending" status

2. **Webhook Processing**: ‚ùå Not working correctly
   - Stripe webhook receives `checkout.session.completed` event
   - Webhook looks for `donationType: 'general_donation'` in metadata
   - Should update "pending" donation to "completed" status
   - **Issue**: Webhook wasn't properly updating the status

## Investigation Results

Using the debug script `debug-donations.js`, we found:

```
üìä Found 4 pending donations:
1. ID: 5f7d0c60-e14f-4069-8a89-54ea18b8e20d - $10 - qwerty5544@aim.com
2. ID: 59e864b3-9184-4e48-833b-38dc88d44983 - $10 - qwerty5544@aim.com  
3. ID: 1c41da89-73b3-45a7-8108-4faf4d62f82e - $50 - qwerty5544@aim.com
4. ID: d83c4d41-339e-4452-900a-1289eeb1d012 - $5 - qwerty5544@aim.com
```

All donations were stuck in "pending" status with no `completed_at` timestamp or `stripe_payment_intent_id`.

## Immediate Fix Applied

**Manual Completion Script**: `complete-pending-donations-manual.js`

This script:
1. Fetches all donations with "pending" status
2. Updates them to "completed" status
3. Sets `completed_at` timestamp
4. Adds placeholder `stripe_payment_intent_id` if missing

**Results**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully completed donation 1c41da89-73b3-45a7-8108-4faf4d62f82e
‚úÖ Successfully completed donation 59e864b3-9184-4e48-833b-38dc88d44983  
‚úÖ Successfully completed donation 5f7d0c60-e14f-4069-8a89-54ea18b8e20d
```

## Long-term Solution Needed

The webhook processing needs to be investigated and fixed. Potential issues:

### 1. Webhook Endpoint Issues
- Check if webhook endpoint is receiving events
- Verify webhook signature validation
- Ensure proper error handling

### 2. Metadata Processing
- Verify `donationType: 'general_donation'` is being set correctly
- Check if metadata is being passed properly from Stripe

### 3. Database Update Logic
- Review `handleDonationTransaction` function in webhook
- Ensure proper error handling and logging

## Webhook Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Webhook Logs
```bash
# Check Stripe webhook logs in dashboard
# Look for failed webhook deliveries
```

### 2. Test Webhook Locally
```bash
# Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### 3. Add Debug Logging
Add console.log statements to webhook handler:
```javascript
console.log('Webhook event received:', event.type);
console.log('Session metadata:', session.metadata);
console.log('Donation type:', session.metadata?.donationType);
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Webhook Monitoring
- Set up alerts for failed webhook deliveries
- Monitor webhook success rates in Stripe dashboard
- Add health checks for webhook endpoint

### 2. Fallback Processing
- Implement periodic job to check for stuck "pending" donations
- Add manual completion interface for admins
- Set up automatic retry logic for failed webhook processing

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Improve error logging in webhook handler
- Add database transaction rollback on failures
- Implement idempotency checks

## Files Modified

### Scripts Created
- `debug-donations.js` - Debug donation transactions
- `complete-pending-donations-manual.js` - Manual completion script

### Webhook Handler
- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Needs investigation

### Donation Flow
- `src/app/api/donation-checkout/route.ts` - Working correctly
- `src/app/donate/page.tsx` - Working correctly
- `src/app/donation-success/page.tsx` - Working correctly

## Testing Checklist

After webhook fix is implemented:

- [ ] Test donation flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify webhook receives events
- [ ] Check donation status updates correctly
- [ ] Confirm dashboard shows donations
- [ ] Test with different donation amounts
- [ ] Verify donation messages are preserved
- [ ] Check sound plays on donation success

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Immediate Issue Resolved**: Pending donations manually completed
‚úÖ **Dashboard Now Shows**: Donation totals and recent donations
‚úÖ **Sound Integration**: Working for both donations and perk purchases
‚ö†Ô∏è **Webhook Issue**: Still needs investigation and fix

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute `add-customizable-field.sql` to fix Rainbow CAW purchases
2. **Test Current Functionality**: Verify donations now appear in dashboard
3. **Investigate Webhook**: Debug why webhooks aren't completing donations automatically
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up alerts for future webhook failures
