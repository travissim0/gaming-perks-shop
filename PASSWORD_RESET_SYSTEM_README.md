# Password Reset System

## Overview
Complete forgot password and reset password functionality for the Gaming Perks Shop website using Supabase Auth.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Forgot Password Request (`/auth/forgot-password`)
- **Purpose**: Users can request password reset emails
- **Process**: 
  - User enters their email address
  - System sends password reset email via Supabase
  - User receives email with secure reset link
- **UI**: Modern gaming-themed interface matching existing auth pages

### 2. Password Reset (`/auth/reset-password`)
- **Purpose**: Users set new password after clicking email link
- **Process**:
  - Verifies reset link from email
  - Allows user to set new password
  - Redirects to login after successful reset
- **Security**: Validates password length and confirmation matching

### 3. Login Integration
- **Added**: "Forgot password?" link on login page
- **Location**: Next to password field for easy access

## Files Created

### Pages
- `src/app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Password reset request form
- `src/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - New password setting form

### Documentation
- `PASSWORD_RESET_SYSTEM_README.md` - This file

## Manual Password Reset (Emergency)

For immediate password resets (like Ron's case), two options are available:

### Option 1: JavaScript Script (Recommended)
```bash
node reset-ron-password.js
```
- Uses Supabase Admin API
- More secure and follows proper auth flow
- Requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable

### Option 2: SQL Script (Direct Database)
- Run `reset-ron-password.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- Direct database update
- Bypasses Supabase auth mechanisms
- Used for Ron's password reset to `Changeme@123`

## User Workflow

### Normal Password Reset
1. User goes to login page
2. Clicks "Forgot password?" link
3. Enters email address on forgot password page
4. Receives email with reset link
5. Clicks link in email (goes to `/auth/reset-password`)
6. Sets new password
7. Redirected to login page
8. Logs in with new password

### Emergency Admin Reset
1. Admin runs manual reset script
2. Admin informs user of temporary password
3. User logs in with temporary password
4. User should change password for security

## Security Features

- **Email Verification**: Reset links are sent to registered email only
- **Secure Tokens**: Supabase handles secure token generation
- **Password Validation**: Minimum 6 characters, confirmation matching
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling during reset process
- **Link Expiration**: Reset links expire automatically (Supabase default)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key  # For admin scripts only
```

### Supabase Configuration
- Email templates can be customized in Supabase Dashboard
- Redirect URLs are configured in the forgot password implementation
- Email sending is handled automatically by Supabase

## Styling
- Matches existing auth page design
- Gaming-themed UI with cyan/blue gradients
- Dark theme with proper contrast
- Mobile responsive
- Loading states and error handling

## Testing the System

### Test Forgot Password Flow
1. Go to `/auth/forgot-password`
2. Enter valid email address
3. Check email inbox for reset link
4. Click reset link
5. Set new password
6. Verify login works with new password

### Test Emergency Reset
1. Run reset script for test user
2. Verify user can login with new password
3. Confirm password works as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Email not received**: Check spam folder, verify email is registered
- **Reset link expired**: Request new reset email
- **Invalid reset link**: May have been used already or expired

### Admin Issues
- **Script fails**: Check environment variables are set
- **Database access**: Ensure proper Supabase permissions
- **User not found**: Verify email/alias spelling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Password strength requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Email template customization
- Admin dashboard for password resets
- Audit log for password changes
- Two-factor authentication integration

### Integration Ideas
- Discord/Steam account linking
- In-game password reset notifications
- Bulk password reset for events
- Automated password expiry policies
